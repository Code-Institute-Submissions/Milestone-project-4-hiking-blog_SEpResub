## Design Thinking

 - Purpose of the blog
   - I think that there is many people out there who is looking for a solid blog where you can find many tips when it comes to hiking and at the same time a blog with a beautiful design and unique character that people can interact with.

 - Persona.
   - let us dive into the projects persona. The persona is named Stephanie, She is 26 years old and is working full time with a quit good salary. She is single and cannot be still for to long. She likes adventures and to discover new places. She works to save money for her next trip because she loves travelling and she wants to discover the world as much as she can before she sattle down and having a family. 

   - The design.
     - When I designed this blog I wanted it to look inspiring, trustworthy and playful. I thought that those factors where key thing for the persona Stephanie to like the page. I choosed the typography Kalam as it looks handwritten and playful. I styled the cards and images with round corners and a dropshadow to create that same effect. I choosed blue colors as I think they are soft and give the user an inpression of trustworthyness and seriousness but in the same time the colors really fit the style. The images are unique and not from the intrenet as I think that is the kind of images that gives character and can inspire the user.
